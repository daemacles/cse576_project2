Replace your_pano.jpg with the image you want to show (JPG format).

Image name should be SurnameA_and_SurnameB_WIN2012.jpg so it's obvious who you are.

Edit your_pano.ivr to have the correct name and camera parameters.

Rename your_pano.ivr to match.

Edit index.html to point to the correct file.

Open index.html in a compatible browser.



Since you need this working for several panoramas, rename the index.html files for each.

The images MUST be in .JPG format and in the same directory as the applet files!
